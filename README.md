Just a note: the video went barely over 15 minutes. I increased the speed of the video a little bit, which you may notice... but it saves you some time.

Also, the giphy API has a limit of calls per hour. When the call fails it reverts to a default gif. The video confirms that it works, if you keep getting the same image you may have to try again later.
